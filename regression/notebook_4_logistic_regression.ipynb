Our goal is to build a model that is able to determine wether or not a commercial aircraft flight will be delayed or not, based on information such as the weather conditions and the carrier of the flight.\n","\n","In logistic regression for binary classification, there are only 2 classes: 1 and 0. An output Z is calculated as a linear function of the features. The result of this is \"activated\" with a softmax activation function, causing the resulting output to fall in the interval ]0,1[, interpreted as a probability P(Y'=1). Then, at prediction time, we will predict \"1\" if the output is above some threshold (usually 0.5).\n","\n","$Z = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n$\n","\n","$Y' =  sigmoid(Z) = 1/(1+exp(-Z)$\n","\n","Before we can actually start creating and fitting the model, the majority of our work will consist of exploration and preparation of the data and some basic feature engineering.

We will say that a flight is delayed (1) if the arrival delay is higher than 15 minutes.
